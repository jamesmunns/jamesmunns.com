I am a software engineer focused on building the right solution for the right challenge. I have worked on platforms ranging from real time and safety critical software developed in C, to rapidly prototyping IoT use cases developed in weeks. By working with a wide range of technologies, features, and limitations, I am always pushing the limits of my skills, and willing to adapt the best design for the task at hand.

I have an easygoing personality, and enjoy diving deep into technical knowledge, as well as relating this knowledge in an easy to consume format for customers, stakeholders, and management.

# **Areas of focus**

* **Embedded Systems**
    * Safety critical and real time systems in the fields of Avionics and Gas Detection
    * Rapidly prototyped bare-metal systems for IoT use cases
* **Linux Systems**
    * OpenWRT, Debian, and Yocto based systems for non-real time embedded platforms requiring internet connectivity for domain specific usage
    * Orchestration and automation of tasks ranging from containerized web services to data parsing and management
* **Programming Languages**
    * C, Python, Rust, C++, Bash

# **Personal Projects**

In my personal time, I take time to explore new technologies that interest me, writing or speaking about areas I am knowledgeable in or currently learning, and contribute back to open source projects. My most recent work in these areas include:

* [teensy3-rs](https://github.com/jamesmunns/teensy3-rs) - An autogenerated set of bindings in Rust for the Teensy3, a Kinetis ARM Cortex-M based development board
* [coap-rs](https://github.com/Covertness/coap-rs) - A CoAP library written in Rust
* [Constrained Devices and the Internet of Things](https://www.meetup.com/IoT-Innovation-Lab/events/234755538/) - A one hour introduction to embedded systems for non-engineers
