# Weihnachts Hack 2016

## What is it?

A 16 day event from December 16th to December 31st to build a project with a small team of other people in Berlin

## How does it work?

The idea is to bring together a bunch of people who would otherwise be bored over the two weeks around the holiday, and give them something really cool to do. We'll get together a couple times before the event to meet and decide on a project (or a few projects, if enough people are interested). The event will kick off December 16th with project announcements, we'll have one progress show and tell on the 23rd, and the final show and tell on the 31st.

There is no corporate sponsor, no free mate, no silly prizes. Just a chance to learn new things, flex current skills, and meet new people. Your team decides what to do with it (open source it, commercialize it, delete it).

Don't feel like working much? No problem. Not here the entire two weeks? No problem. Don't have any ideas? No Problem. No ticket? Nicht mir egal.
