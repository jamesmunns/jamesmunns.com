So, its been one week. Lets start with how the week went. **tl;dr**: Great at Rust, okay at cleaning, pretty mediocre at exercise. 100 minutes every day adds up to a lot, but honestly probably not too much.

### Twenty Minutes of Body Weight Exercise

Summary: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; - (3/5)

**Past week:**

This week I did much more exercise than I normally did. I solidly met my goals 3 days this week, had one mediocre day, and didn't really work out at all the other three days. Two of those days, I didn't wake up early enough to work out in the morning, and went straight from work to meet up with friends/coworkers for dinner and beers. The third day (Saturday) I don't even have a good excuse, I just didn't make exercise a priority. This past week I did:

Exercise \| | Amount
:-----------|---------:
burpees     | 12
squats      | 50
planks      | 170s
wall sits   | 130s
pushups     | 40
lunges      | 20
chair dips  | 30

<br>

**Goals for the upcoming week**

One of the hardest parts for me were the days where I went straight from home, to work, to meeting for dinner or drinks, especially if I am finding time for the other thirty day goals like working in Rust or cleaning.

For days like this in the upcoming week, I will try and do more passive learning in Rust (reading, podcasts, etc), and spend more time during lunch/breaks to get a little workout done, such as climbing stairs, or just going on a 20 minute walk. Twenty minutes of a few little things are better than nothing. Right now, I'm not comfortable enough doing pushups or burpees in a conference room, even if I don't really have any reason not to.

I also have some travel planned over the next few weeks, so getting a system down is especially important.

### Twenty Minutes of Cleaning

Summary: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; - (4/5)

**Past week:**

I didn't do a great job of capturing this. I feel like I probably met my goal 6 days out of 7, and my kitchen is much cleaner, thanks to the help of my lovely wife. I spent a lot of my 20 minutes a day doing dishes, mostly because I am terrible at being efficient while cooking.

**Goals for the upcoming week:**

Stop counting dishes towards the 20 minutes. This will make this part much harder, but lead to a better outcome. We'll see if its too overwhelming.

### One Hour of Rust

Summary: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; - (5/5)

**Past Week:**

Between reading about Rust, and working on a few examples, I've managed to hit or exceed my goal every day this week. I also wrote a quick high level post about [interfacing rust to other languages]({% post_url 2016-08-04-interfacing-with-rust %}), which will likely be what I work on for the next days.

**Goals for the upcoming week:**

Put more work into my interfacing posts, and share some of the examples I worked on during the past week. As always, you can find more info on my [Github feed](https://github.com/jamesmunns?tab=activity).
