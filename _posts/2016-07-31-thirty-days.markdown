When someone asks me what my hobbies are, my usual answer is something like "Well, programming I guess, I like cooking, oh yeah, I play a little bit of Ukulele too!", which overall isn't a very exciting or convincing answer. I have a ton of things I do a little bit of, and even more that I want to make progress on. How can I not only get better at things, and FEEL like I've gotten better at something, or anything?

I've had a couple discussions recently about how to make progress on goals, both professionally and personally. From a work perspective, techniques like SCRUM focus on setting achievable and atomic goals in a timeframe that can be comprehended. On a personal level, a coworker shared a story about spending 15 minutes a day on something to see improvement. I've even seen a TED talk about it:

<a class="embedly-card" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days">Matt Cutts: Try something new for 30 days</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

In the end, I feel like all of these techniques boil down to three important things:

* Picking a resonable goal in an achievable amount of time (instead of "get in shape", "learn German")
* Commitment to something, whether its:
    * Effort Oriented, i.e. X minutes a day until Y date, or
    * Goal Oriented, i.e. Achieve X by Y date
* Measuring and reflection on what was achieved, for better or for worse

A few days ago, I decided to commit to picking a few bite sized 30 day goals, and sticking with them for 30 days. Conveniently, tomorrow is the first of August, so heres the plan:

* Last day of the month is sprint planning. I pick 1-N goals that I think that I can commit to for a whole month. I will:
    * Publicly announce what the goals are, and what my success criteria are
* Throughout the month, write and reflect on how things are going, or what I have learned on a bite-sized level. This could be here, or on twitter (see @bitshiftmask)
* Once a week (probably Sundays) reflect on how the week went for my goals. Provide introspective feedback on how well it is going, or what needs to change to meet my goals
* At the end of the month, honestly review how I did on my goals, and a summary of what I learned through the experience

Expect the first goal announcement later today.

Lets see how this goes. Let me know on twitter if you decide to join in!
